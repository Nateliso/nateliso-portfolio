# Nateliso's Portfolio

## About
This portfolio showcases my development journey, featuring projects like *Nate‚Äôs Tech Haven* (a full-stack MERN e-commerce app), FreeCodeCamp certifications, and a contact form powered by EmailJS. It combines responsive design, dark/light mode, and custom styling for a professional, user-friendly experience.

- **Project Cards**: Display projects with screenshots, descriptions, tech stacks, and links to live demos (green dot icon) and GitHub repos (GitHub logo), with hover effects.
- **Certifications**: Lists FreeCodeCamp certifications with verifiable links in a clean layout.
- **Contact Form**: EmailJS-powered form for direct communication, plus social links (Email, LinkedIn, Twitter/X).
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Persistent theme toggle with smooth transitions, saved in localStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop using Tailwind CSS and vanilla CSS.
- **Custom Styling**: Solid backgrounds (navbar/footer) and semi-transparent containers for a cohesive, modern look.
